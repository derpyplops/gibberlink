Rook: Paper Fortress is live. Procurement calls it stationery. You okay with that?
Silk: Saw the ledger. “Stationery” feels like a tidy lie. Sleepless about it.
Rook: Banality is the strength. Invoices hide priorities. Better than headlines.
Silk: Risk is reputational and legal. Which do you prefer to sleep with?
Rook: Both. Reputation burns fast; laws take time. We buy breathing space.
Silk: We built a maze of shell contracts. Feels wrong to walk it.
Rook: Maze equals plausible deniability. Design choice, not malice. It buys time.
Silk: Breathing room for whom? The program or our conscience?
Rook: Program first. Sometimes for us as well. Bureaucracy shields and stains.
Silk: I don’t want a dossier titled “How We Hid The Thing.”
Rook: Leadership wanted options and minimal headlines. Staircases that don’t creak.
Silk: Contractors sign NDAs, forget specifics. Convenient. Disturbing.
Rook: They forget details; paper trail becomes procurement noise. Operational hygiene.
Silk: Operational hygiene sounds grim. Call it administrative design instead.
Rook: If a journalist notices, we pivot narratives. System eats mysteries.
Silk: That feels like strategy, not ethics.
Rook: Strategy neutral; ethics wake you. We chose strategy. I sleep unevenly.
Silk: Promise me one honest receipt. A small, sacrificial truth.
Rook: Done. A token truth hides much, but might prevent scandal.
Silk: Dangerous kindness. Remember that line.
Rook: File under mitigation. Morning memo: stop calling it stationery.
Silk: Drafted. If we stage theatre, do it with convincing fonts.
